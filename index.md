**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter has been the variability in LLMs when discovering biases. These studies are ever-changing because new models are coming out constantly so the outcome is different every time we run the model.
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I would like to investigate LLMs biases. My current Quarter 1 project is exploring trends in college admissions based on pronouns, race, income, and gpa. Next quarter, it would be interesting to explore how LLM may have biases in determining trustability based on images of different people. 
**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I would change the pace of beginning my project because now I have a better idea of the process. My Quarter 1 project was individual so I would communicate with my team and/or partner to create a timeline with goals we want to hit for our presentation.
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I am interested in learning more about creating a functional website that I could present to people. I want to improve my communication skills and my ability to present. I am also interested in exploring different platforms to run LLMs and what would be fastest or seeing if it yields different results..
